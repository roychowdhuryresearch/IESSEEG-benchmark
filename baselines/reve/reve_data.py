"""Adapting IESSEEG recordings to REVE's expected input.

REVE is the least intrusive of the pre-trained baselines to adapt: it is
trained at **200 Hz**, which is IESSEEG's native rate, and it takes
electrode positions explicitly rather than assuming a fixed montage. So
unlike LUNA (montage reorder + polarity fix + resample) and EEGPT
(rename + resample), REVE needs only:

1. Channel naming. Our referential tree suffixes channels with `-REF`
   (`FP1-REF`); REVE's position bank is keyed on the bare electrode name.
2. Positions. Taken from the official `brain-bzh/reve-positions` bank
   rather than derived locally, so the coordinates are exactly the ones
   the model was pre-trained against.

No resampling is applied, so the signal reaching the model is the
released data itself.
